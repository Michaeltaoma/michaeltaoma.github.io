一直很想把自己之前上课做过的所有笔记都放出来，以下的笔记是按照课程来分类的，作为一个分享也作为一个自己笔记的整理，有些笔记是影印版的，所以大的离谱

The following notes are classified according to the course, as a share and as a collation of notes, some of which are photocopied, so they are outrageously large

### The University of British Columbia

### Queen's University

#### CISC452: Neural and Genetic Computing

<a href="assets/pdf/452_combine.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture Notes</a>

*Introduction to neural and genetic computing. Topics include associative memory systems, neural optimization strategies, supervised and unsupervised classification networks, genetic algorithms, genetic and evolutionary programming. Applications are examined, and the relation to biologic systems is discussed.*

#### CISC324: Operating Systems
<a href="assets/pdf/gener_324.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture Notes</a>

<a href="assets/pdf/324Final.pdf" target="_blank">Final Notes</a>

*Layered operating systems for conventional shared memory computers: concurrent processes. Synchronization and communication. Concurrent algorithms. Scheduling. Deadlock. Memory management. Protection. File systems. Device management. Typical layers.*

#### CISC223: Software Specifications
<a href="assets/pdf/223_final.pdf" target="_blank">Final Notes</a>

*Introduction to techniques for specifying the behaviour of software, with applications of these techniques to design, verification and construction of software. Logic-based techniques such as loop invariants and class invariants. Automata and grammar-based techniques, with applications to scanners, parsers, user-interface dialogs and embedded systems. Computability issues in software specifications.*


#### CISC365：Algorithm
<a href="assets/pdf/365Note.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture Notes</a>

*Principles of design, analysis and implementation of efficient algorithms. Case studies from a variety of areas illustrate divide and conquer methods, the greedy approach, branch and bound algorithms and dynamic programming.*

#### CISC124: Intro to Computer Science II
<a href="assets/pdf/124_REVIEW.pdf" target="_blank">Final Notes</a>

*Introduction to object-oriented design, architecture, and programming. Use of packages, class libraries, and interfaces. Encapsulation and representational abstraction. Inheritance. Polymorphic programming. Exception handling. Iterators. Introduction to a class design notation. Applications in various areas.*
